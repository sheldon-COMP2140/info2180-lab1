        <p>I am a 2nd year UWI student pursuing a BSc Information Technology. So far, this course seems to be moving fast which
            means I need to double my efforts to keep up. Not only am I interested in this course to complete my degree
            but I want to learn how to create good websites. I believe that having the skill to create websites is also
            a good secondary source of income.
